Often these conservation areas have side trails, which are trails that are less groomed, usually more dangerous, but also a lot more interesting. I found myself always wanting to go down the side trails, to explore the path less travelled, and see what we'd find.\n\nThis mirrors my process for understanding and solving problems. The question isn't just how do we solve this problem, but what is the most optimal solution? In order to find the most optimal solution, I believe you need to explore the various options, a.k.a. the side trails, to get to there. This doesn't necessarily mean that all trails will yield useful or relevant information, but what it does do is provide a greater appreciation and understanding of the scope of the entire problem.\n\nProblems can often be interpreted in more than one way, and if you can gather enough information to reframe the problem, novel solutions can be developed that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. If you stick to the main trail, to do what is obvious, to never deviate from the status quo, you may be unknowingly leaving a better, long-term solution on the table."}}]}}}
