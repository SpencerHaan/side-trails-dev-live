Any missing context or understanding can instead be requested as needed, allowing everyone’s shared understanding to develop and evolve more naturally, layer by layer.\n\nSince all participants are in the same room at the same time, no one is waiting on a response that may be only prompting for clarification or is misunderstanding what the author wrote.\n"}},{"childMdx":{"id":"3d45a4d1-74cc-51df-84ee-9882ea871c15","frontmatter":{"title":"Optimize for flexibility, adaptability and simplicity"},"body":"\nWith software development changing requirements are inevitable; there will always be “unknown unknowns”.\n\nOptimizing for flexibility is welcoming these changes, even when they might be late into development. It can mean the difference between a solution that solves your problem well and one that does not.\n\nOptimizing for simplicity is avoiding unnecessary work. Figure out a quick solution, prove out your ideas first, then move onto the next problem. Each problem solved adds to a greater understanding of the bigger picture. You might learn that past solutions were actually wrong.\n\nOptimizing for adaptability is ensuring these solutions can either be modified or replaced, and that everyone involved is willing to come back to the table for further discussion.\n"}},{"childMdx":{"id":"b9823d79-d003-58d7-bba7-6f9dbad7e3bb","frontmatter":{"title":"Customer satisfaction from working software"},"body":"\n#### Core Ideas:\n  - \"Customer satisfaction through valuable software.\"\n  - \"Working software is the primary measure of progress.\"\n"}},{"childMdx":{"id":"2c92de44-bc75-5117-9fd5-f48a70ccaa5c","frontmatter":{"title":"Sustainable development from simplicity, continuous delivery, and excellence"},"body":"\n#### Core Ideas:\n- Continuous delivery of working software, as quickly as possible.\n- Sustainable development can be maintained indefinitely.\n- Enhance agility through technical excellence.\n- Keep it simple."}},{"childMdx":{"id":"f103edd5-cb3c-57fc-95a2-5f2928fb86ca","frontmatter":{"title":"Success comes from empowered individuals in self-organizing teams"},"body":"\n#### Core Ideas:\n- Successful projects involve trusted and motivated individuals.\n- Self-organizing teams lead to the best architectures, requirements, and designs."}}]}}}
